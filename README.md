## **Project Details & Tools**
1. AWS Infrastructure: We leveraged AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 20. T2.large) for development environments and EKS Cluster deployment.
2. Automated Setup: Utilizing AWS CLI, kubectl, and eksctl, we streamlined EKS Cluster creation and configuration.
3. Jenkins Integration: We integrated Jenkins with essential plugins (Docker, Kubernetes) for robust CI/CD workflows.
4. Docker and Kubernetes Orchestration: We orchestrated Docker image builds, repository management, and Kubernetes deployments with seamless integration.
5. ArgoCD Pipelines: Developing efficient ArgoCD pipelines with webhook triggers, GitOps workflows, and Kubernetes configurations, we leveraged automated sync, declarative deployments, and multi-environment management to optimize microservice deployments and ensure seamless CI/CD integration.

## **What are the challenges encounter from the starting of the project?**

- `Challenge(1)` Providing real-time updates for wallet in via time, history, ledger, which requires efficient communication between the backend and the front-end.
- `Challenge(2)` Supporting both local currency operations and some foreign currency swapping involves accurate and up-to-date exchange rate handling, which can be resource-intensive.
- `Challenge(3)` The platform must handle high traffic and complex operations wallet transactions and prevent multiple api call on withdraws, transfer calls without degrading performance. 
- `Challenge(4)` Ensuring compliance with local and international regulations for payment systems.
- `Challenge(5)` Detecting Sophisticated Fraud Patterns- Fraudsters often use complex strategies that blend legitimate and illegitimate activities, making detection difficult.
- `Challenge(6)` **Security Threats**: Protecting against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, DDoS, and other web application vulnerabilities in a microservices environment.

## **How were we able to overcome these challenges?**

- `Solution(1)` I implemented WebSockets to establish a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between the server and clients. This allows the backend to push instant updates to the front-end the moment a transaction occurs, eliminating the need for inefficient client-side polling and ensuring users see their balance and history update in real-time.
- `Solution(2)` To overcome this, we integrated with a reputable third-party financial data API for live and historical exchange rates. We implemented a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store these rates for a short period (e.g., 5-10 minutes), significantly reducing the number of external API calls and protecting against rate limits. For currency swaps, we used database transactions to ensure atomicity, guaranteeing that the debit from one currency and the credit to another either both succeed or both fail.
- `Solution(3)` **High Traffic and Performance at Scale**
    - The platform must handle high traffic volumes and complex transactional operations (like withdrawals and transfers) without degrading performance, especially by preventing duplicate or malicious API calls that could lead to double-spending or financial losses.
        - *Solution:* We adopted a microservices architecture to decouple services, allowing them to scale independently. To specifically solve the problem of duplicate API calls (e.g., from client-side retries), we implemented Idempotency Keys using Hazelcast as our distributed cache.
            - How it works: Before processing a non-idempotent request (like a withdrawal or transfer), the client must generate a unique idempotency key. The server checks this key against the Hazelcast cluster.
            - If the key is new, the request is processed, and the key is stored with the request's result.
            - If the key exists, the server returns the stored response instead of reprocessing the transaction, preventing duplicate operations.
            This, combined with API rate limiting and database optimization, ensured system stability and data integrity under high load
- `Solution(4)` Ensuring compliance with evolving local and international financial regulations (e.g., KYC, AML) is critical for the platform's legality and user trust.
- *Solution:* The system was designed with security and compliance as a core tenet. This includes secure data storage, end-to-end encryption, and immutable audit trails. We integrated with specialized compliance services for automated KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks during user onboarding and transaction monitoring. Furthermore, we established a process for regularly reviewing and updating our internal policies to align with the evolving regulatory landscape.
- `Solution(5)` Created middleware for advanced security fraud detection:
    - Implemented middleware for IP address monitoring and transaction interception based on several criteria
         - **Large Transactions:** Flagged transactions exceeding platform-defined thresholds for further review.
         - **High-Frequency Transactions:** Monitored accounts for unusually high transaction volumes within short time-frames to detect suspicious behavior or could indicate potential money laundering or illegal activity.
         - **Geographic and Risk-Based Monitoring:**  Identified transactions involving high-risk regions/countries or blacklisted wallet addresses to comply with AML regulations.
         - **Behavioral Analysis:** Detected inconsistent behavior, such as large deviations from typical transaction amounts, to prevent fraud 
         - **Multiple Accounts Sharing the Same IP:** Checked for potential sybil attacks by monitoring accounts initiating transactions from the same IP address.
             - **Reason:**
                 - This could be a sign of suspicious activity such as a single entity controlling multiple accounts.
        - **Deposits Followed by Immediate Transfers:** Flagged immediate fund transfers after deposits to prevent potential money laundering activities.
            - **Reason:**
                - This behavior could indicate attempts to obfuscate the origin of the funds (layering phase of money laundering).
        - Implement data Encryption.
        - Implement Event Sourcing to make history difficult to tamper.
        - When any of this list options is detected during user transaction process we call for assistance to block that user wallet and move the transaction (user money) to escrow service with user details or depending the list of crime system found user, system can disable user account which means user can login, deposit but can not withdraw. If user is blocked user can not login his account.

- `Solution(6)` **Multi-Layered Security Architecture**:
    - *Solution:* We implemented a comprehensive 5-layer security architecture combining NGINX perimeter defense with Spring Boot application security:
        1. **NGINX WAF**: Pattern-based attack blocking at the network perimeter
        2. **Spring Security Filters**: Deep content validation and input sanitization
        3. **Exception Handling**: Graceful error responses without information leakage
        4. **Business Logic Security**: Application-specific fraud detection and validation
        5. **Infrastructure Security**: Container hardening and secure service communication
    This defense-in-depth approach ensures that even if one layer is bypassed, multiple other layers provide protection.

   notification-service/src/main/resources/application.yml
   ```

   Locate the **email configuration section**, and update it with your **email app password** (for example, a Gmail App Password).
   This is required so that the `notification-service` can send and receive email messages.

   Example:

   ```yaml
   spring:
     mail:
       host: smtp.gmail.com
       port: 587
       username: your_email@gmail.com
       password: your_app_password
       properties:
         mail:
           smtp:
             auth: true
             starttls:
               enable: true
   ```

4. **Build and start all services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will:

   * Build all microservice images
   * Start containers for backend services, frontend, database, and supporting tools (Redis, RabbitMQ, Zipkin, etc.)
   * Set up all necessary networks

5. **Access the application**
